As an assistant English teacher, I help the primary teachers in teaching English.  Most of the time, they are not trained in English, so I am supposed to help them navigate the curriculum.  I was recently asked to play the shamisen in one of my classes, but I was very hesitant to do so because it is not part of the curriculum: I was specifically asked to play multiple local folk songs and the kids were to sing along.  Now, I normally wouldn't have a problem if the request were outside of class, but I only come by the school maybe twice a month and the educational standards for English are quite rigorous.  So, I was politely pushing back and smiling as my mind was internally screaming "We're behind on the curriculum!"  After we started the lesson, the teacher kept asking me to play more songs and so I would play a verse and would look to the teacher with an expression saying "Okay, let's move on..."

I also used the opportunity to teach about folk music from my own hometown.  Many Americans who do not know about the shamisen might call it a Japanese banjo, as the sound and shape are very similar.  And it is very much like Bluegrass in that it is a distinctive style of folk music played in a remote region.  (I showed an old demonstration of the Banjo by Tracy Newman).  Other Japanese have made the connection as well, as the local shamisen shop has a banjo sitting in a prominent display case.  

The kids were very happy to see a foreigner taking the time to learn their local instruments and dialect.  And it helped remind me that the larger part of my job is *not* in fact teaching English, it's *intercultural outreach*.  Getting kids enthused about other cultures is more important than teaching English for the simple fact that kids who are enthused are more likely to learn about the topic.  And while curricula and textbooks are extremely important, they are only guidelines and can be disregarded if the situation calls for it.

I think I am also unaccustomed to receiving praise.  It makes me uncomfortable and I don't know how to accept it.  I've gotten better at it these past few years, but it's still something I have to overcome.
