#+TITLE: About This Site
* About This Site
This is my personal blog, though I limit the subject matter to just a few topics, namely language, music, and technology that relates to such things.

This site was entirely written within and built using [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs]]' [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode suite]] and is hosted by [[https://github.com/][Github]].

I know very little about programming or coding, so I compose each page as an plaintext outline in org-mode's markdown-like notation, which Emacs then exports to HTML via pandoc.  I then sync the site directory with a Github repository, which allows me to edit the site from my various computers.
