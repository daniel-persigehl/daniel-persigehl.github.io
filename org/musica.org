Music is a mystery.  It is the transcedent, the mathematical, made tangible.  It is beauty, emotion.  It triggers awe.

It is a catalyst.

Now, I am not by nature very emotional.  In fact, I am rather stoic: I almost never cry, and my friends point out that they have never seen me angry, and yet the single most emotional experience I've had was wandering into a church where Gregorian chant was wafting softly through the rafters.  I wasn't even Christian, I was merely curious about the use of Latin by a real-world community,  but it touched something deep inside me and provoked me to tears.

Religious music is designed to provoke these transcendent experiences.  Take, for example, this Polish [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blhCxT_LcZs][Orthodox chant]].  Like other types of folk music, it is composed not for novelty but for staying power and has been refined over generations.  This is by no means limited to religious or folk music.  Take for example these two songs from Berlioz' opera /Les Troyens/: "[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCR1WCJ7o9Q][Vallon Sonore]]" and "[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPb-ZR88qG0][Gloire à Didon]]," two songs at opposite ends of the emotional spectrum.  Or where would we be without Beethoven's [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOjHhS5MtvA][/Symphony No. 9/]], which is widely held to be one of the crowning achievements of human culture?

However, there are as many styles of music as there are cultures around the world.  So music is only subjective, right?

#+begin_quote

However, there are certain aspects of music that seem universal.  The particulars of music of course change from culture to culture, but certain things seem universal.  The progression [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJIO-Jr0E8o][from a dissonance to a consonance]], for example, is inherently satisfying.  A sense of rhythm is also a necessity, though the standards of what constitutes that varies.  Fixed musical scales, as in certain ratios between tones, though they need not be tied to specific sound frequencies, are a must.  [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjrsqJaLDOg][Gregorian chant]] has neither an absolute scale (it changes to fit a choir's vocal range) nor fixed rhythm (it is modeled after the flow of speech), yet is the origin of the Western musical tradition.  Similarly, the intervals between notes in Byzantine chant do not align with those in solfege.  Traditional Japanese music is based off a pentatonic scale.

But /why/ does music provoke these responses in us?
* Applied Mathematics
To the casual listener, music is an artform and is a good song is simply whatever "sounds good."  To the learned musician, however, it is a science as well.  Music is one of the ways mathematics, arguably the purest and most abstract science, can be made tangible.

At its most basic, rhythm takes an arbitrary length of time (a "measure") and divides it into smaller units, such as half notes.  These half notes can be halved in turn, becoming quarter notes, then eighth, sixteenth, thirty-second notes and so on.

One of the basic skills in music is rhythmic variation.  A well known example is Mozart's twelve variations on the French folk tune "Ah, vous dirai-je Maman," which is better known by its English title "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star."  The core melody is the same throughout the piece, but the composer has added ornamentation to alter its sound.

However, it is not just rhythm, but sound is itself mathematical.  The ancient mystic Pythagoras, though remembered today as a mathematician, was well known in antiquity for his theories of music.

#+begin_quote
ἐν τοῖς ὀρθογωνίοις τριγώνοις τὸ ἀπὸ τῆς τὴν ὀρθὴν γωνίαν ὑποτεινούσης πλευρᾶς τετράγωνον ἴσον ἐστὶ τοῖς ἀπὸ τῶν τὴν ὀρθὴν γωνίαν περιεχουσῶν πλευρῶν τετραγώνοις

The above principle, rendedered /a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}/ in modern notation, is famously attributed to Pythagoras, though none of his writings survive.[fn:1]
#+end_quote

It seems strange to us today, but music was crucial to Pythagoras' conception of the universe.  In fact, Pythagoras was historically credited with the invention of music theory when one day he was walking down the street and was struck by the ringing of blacksmiths' hammers.  It sounded like music.  Upon approaching the smithies, he saw that the hammers were of different sizes.  He investigated how the different hammers used by the blacksmiths produced different tones in direct proportion to the hammers' weight.  Thus, Pythagoras was the first to discover the relation between music and mathematics.[fn:3]

In Western music theory there exist only 12 distinct (semi)tones, and yet they are combined to produce all music from the simple to the sublime.  It is for this very reason that pianos are the core of music of music education, as its ability to play several notes at the same time allows virtually any song to be reproduced and performed by a single musician.  See how the most famous works in the Classical repertoire can be combined together into a single work:

Thus, music teaches us not only to appreciate beauty, but that a whole is more than the sum of its parts.  
* One of the /Quadrivium/, One of the /Artes Liberales/

Depiction of the 7 Liberal Arts from the 12th c. manuscript /Hortus deliciarum/.

Clockwise from the top: /Grammar/, /Rhetoric/, /Logic/, /Music/, /Arithmetic/, /Geometry/, and /Astronomy/ with  /Philosophy/ enthroned at their center and whose words are written down by Socrates and Plato.

Although it is a minor part of most curricula and is only taught in-depth to those going on to become musicians, an education is not truly complete without a basic knowledge of music.

The traditional Liberal Arts curriculum traces its origins back over 2,000 years to the /artes liberales/ or /humaniores/ of ancient Greece and Rome, the skills fitting the education of freemen.  It was codified into two sets of skills, of which the consisted of grammar, logic, and rhetoric.  These were the basic skills on which all others depend and which formed the basis of elementary or grammar school.

#+begin_quote
/Arte regens dia que sunt ego Philosophia, subjectas artes in septem divido partes/.

"With divine skill (/ars/), I, Philosophy, rule over all arts and divide them into seven parts."

Arithmetic is simple mathematics.  If you apply arithmetic to /space/, you get /geometry/.  If you apply arithmetic to time, you get music.  But what if you apply arithmetic to both space /and/ time?  You get /astronomy/.

This is of course because he was no school teacher, but a philosopher and teacher of men.  He placed particular emphasis on the mathematical skills of arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy.

Pythagoras linked astronomy with music, as astronomy relies on complex mathematical models, and music is the real-world manifestation of math.  The planets, visible only as stars, moved along predictable paths but at different speeds.  And, as movement produces sound, the motions planets ought also to produce sound.

#+begin_quote
ἆρ᾽ οὖν, ἦν δ᾽ ἐγώ, ὦ Γλαύκων, τούτων ἕνεκα κυριωτάτη ἐν μουσικῇ τροφή, ὅτι μάλιστα καταδύεται εἰς τὸ ἐντὸς τῆς ψυχῆς ὅ τε ῥυθμὸς καὶ ἁρμονία, καὶ ἐρρωμενέστατα ἅπτεται αὐτῆς φέροντα τὴν εὐσχημοσύνην, καὶ ποιεῖ εὐσχήμονα

"And is it not for this reason, Glaucon," said I, "that education in music is most sovereign, because more than anything else rhythm and harmony find their way to the inmost soul and take strongest hold upon it, bringing with them and imparting grace, if one is rightly trained...?"

---Plato, Republic, 3.401d trans. Paul Shorey.

#+begin_example
Arithmetic(Space) = Geometry
Arithmetic(Time) = Music
Arithmetic(Space + Time) = Astronomy
∴ Astronomy = Geometry + Music

Although it is not used in many professions, music is also a practical life skill.  At the very least, the ability to sing, read music notation, and know how to play a basic melody on a piano keyboard are of immense value.

Illustration of Scipio's dream from Cicero's /De Republica/ lib. VI.
#+end_center
This principle is illustrated beautifully in Cicero's "Somnium Scipionis," the only fully extant book from his work titled /De Republica/.  In this dialogue, Scipio Africanus, the Roman general who would go on to defeat Carthage, recounts a dream he had where his grandfather gives him a tour of the heavens.

#+begin_quote
(17) Quam cum magis intuerer: 'Quaeso,' inquit Africanus, 'quousque humi defixa tua mens erit? Nonne aspicis, quae in templa veneris? Novem tibi orbibus vel potius globis conexa sunt omnia, quorum unus est caelestis, extimus, qui reliquos omnes complectitur, summus ipse deus arcens et continens ceteros; in quo sunt infixi illi, qui volvuntur, stellarum cursus sempiterni. Cui subiecti sunt septem, qui versantur retro contrario motu atque caelum. Ex quibus summum globum possidet illa, quam in terris Saturniam nominant. Deinde est hominum generi prosperus et salutaris ille fulgor, qui dicitur Iovis; tum rutilus horribilisque terris, quem Martium dicitis; deinde subter mediam fere regionem Sol obtinet, dux et princeps et moderator luminum reliquorum, mens mundi et temperatio, tanta magnitudine, ut cuncta sua luce lustret et compleat. Hunc ut comites consequuntur Veneris alter, alter Mercurii cursus, in infimoque orbe Luna radiis solis accensa convertitur. Infra autem iam nihil est nisi mortale et caducum praeter animos munere deorum hominum generi datos; supra Lunam sunt aeterna omnia. Nam ea, quae est media et nona, Tellus, neque movetur et infima est, et in eam feruntur omnia nutu suo pondera.'

However, he becomes distracted by a grand and beautiful sound that fills his ear.  It is, he says, the sound of the heavenly spheres:

#+begin_quote
(18) Quae cum intuerer stupens, ut me recepi: 'Quid hic?' inquam, 'quis est, qui complet aures, tantus et tam dulcis sonus?' 'Hic est,' inquit, 'ille, qui intervallis disiunctus imparibus, sed tamen pro rata parte distinctis, impulsu et motu ipsorum orbium efficitur et acuta cum gravibus temperans varios aequabiliter concentus efficit; nec enim silentio tanti motus incitari possunt, et natura fert, ut extrema ex altera parte graviter, ex altera autem acute sonent. Quam ob causam summus ille caeli stellifer cursus, cuius conversio est concitatior, acuto et excitato movetur sono, gravissimo autem hic lunaris atque infimus; nam terra nona immobilis manens una sede semper haeret complexa medium mundi locum. Illi autem octo cursus, in quibus eadem vis est duorum, septem efficiunt distinctos intervallis sonos, qui numerus rerum omnium fere nodus est; quod docti homines nervis imitati atque cantibus aperuerunt sibi reditum in hunc locum, sicut alii, qui praestantibus ingeniis in vita humana divina studia coluerunt. (19) Hoc sonitu oppletae aures hominum obsurduerunt; nec est ullus hebetior sensus in vobis, sicut, ubi Nilus ad illa, quae Catadupa nominantur, praecipitat ex altissimis montibus, ea gens, quae illum locum accolit, propter magnitudinem sonitus sensu audiendi caret. Hic vero tantus est totius mundi incitatissima conversione sonitus, ut eum aures hominum capere non possint, sicut intueri solem adversum nequitis, eiusque radiis acies vestra sensusque vincitur.'

Haec ego admirans referebam tamen oculos ad terram identidem.

-- Cicero. /De Republica/ VI.17-19.

It is clear from the historical record that this would have been pregnant with symbolic meaning, but unfortunately, no writings of the Pythagoreans survive, so we cannot understand /what/ it all means exactly, only that it did mean something.  Still, the knowledge of astronomy helps to center man on his position in the world.  The Earth is but a speck at the center of the Universe (from our perspective), surrounded by marvels that are beyond our comprehension.  However, as small as the Earth is, our nations are smaller still, and we are seprated by vast oceans, deserts, and mountains.

#+begin_quote
(20) Tum Africanus: 'Sentio,' inquit, 'te sedem etiam nunc hominum ac domum contemplari; quae si tibi parva, ut est, ita videtur, haec caelestia semper spectato, illa humana contemnito! Tu enim quam celebritatem sermonis hominum aut quam expetendam consequi gloriam potes? Vides habitari in terra raris et angustis in locis et in ipsis quasi maculis, ubi habitatur, vastas solitudines interiectas eosque, qui incolunt terram, non modo interruptos ita esse, ut nihil inter ipsos ab aliis ad alios manare possit, sed partim obliquos, partim transversos, partim etiam adversos stare vobis; a quibus exspectare gloriam certe nullam potestis.

* Queen of the Sciences
#+begin_center
[[./img/philosophia.jpg]]

/Philosophy/ enthroned in the center of the seven Liberal Arts.  All philosophers, even Socrates and Plato, study her wisdom.
#+end_center
Up through the High Medieval period, Theology and Philosophy were intertwined, as the Classical Theist idea of "God" is not, strictly speaking, a personal being, but ὁ λόγος or the underlying logic of the universe.  To use other language, we might analogize it to not simply "the Laws of Physics" but "the Laws of Reality," to encompass not just physical truths but philosophical truths.  Of course, these "Laws of Reality" were interpreted in a Christian context, so the philosophers naturally used the language of Christianity, though often compartmentalized into "Natural Law" (what was able to be discovered through scientific inquiry and human reason) and "Divine Revelation" (what was only knowable through faith).

But where does music fit in with this schema?  Music is the transcendent made manifest.  It is also the sense over which we have the least control.  You can direct your sight, recoil from touch, pinch your nose, and seal your lips, but you cannot block your ears.
#+begin_quote
/Omnis sapientia a domino deo est.  Soli quod desiderant facere possunt sapientes/

"All wisdom comes from the Lord God; only wise men can do what they will."[fn:2]

-- The words of Philosophy, which are being recorded by Socrates and Plato
#+end_quote

In this context, Philosophy is hailed as the Queen of the Sciences, which include all fields of knowledge.  This is why most academics pursue Ph.D.'s: it is not enough to simply be able to teach a subject (Magister Artium / Scientiae), but one must also understand the /philosophy/ of that subject.  One must possess not only technical skills to participate in a field, but wisdom.  One must know their subject, but also how their subject fits in with the world.  /Philosophia/ (/love of wisdom/) can not be taught, but must be cultivated by pursuing knowledge in a variety of subjects.  As in the parable of the Blind Men and the Elephant, one must consider a variety of perspectives to come to true understanding.

But why music?  Arithmetic gives us certainty and universality.  Geometry gives us practical skills.  Astronomy gives us perspective and keeps us grounded, yet at the same time makes us dreamers.  Music?  Music reminds us that there is more to the world than what can be described or proved scientifically.  It reminds us that goodness and beauty are real and that even subjective things can be studied through the light of human reason.

For several years now, I have lived on one of the Amami islands which lie between Okinawa and the Japanese mainland.  These southern islands possess a unique culture and their own family of languages (not merely dialects).  I have been taking music lessons in playing the shamisen and singing these beautiful folk songs.  Click [[file:./shimauta.org][here]] to learn more about them.

[fn:3] The story is certainly apocryphal, however, as the tone depends not on the weight of the hammer but the size of the anvil.  The point, however, does apply to such things as the /lengths of strings/, as any musician knows.  The monochord, a musical instrument whose invention is also attributed to him, is a perfect illustration of this principal, as it consists of a single string over a soundbox.
