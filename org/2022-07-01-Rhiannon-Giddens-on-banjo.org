#+TITLE: Rhiannon Giddens on the banjo
While researching banjo music so that I can share traditional American culture with my students, I came across a video by Met Music featuring Rhiannon Giddens playing "Cripple Creek" on the banjo.  Her fretless banjo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQkcPSpWWCo

She did an interview where she talked about the history of black banjo players: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H7DtIh8akk
